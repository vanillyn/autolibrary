The UAC relocated their experiments to one of the moons of Jupiter. A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel, was granted access. But when it got close to the base, demons poured out. All your comrades were slaughtered or zombified. This time it's not about survival. It's about revenge.  <br />
<br />
The Plutonia Experiment <br />
<br />
Every effort has been made by the nation's top scientists to close the seven interdimensional Gates of Hell, but one portal remains open. Alone, you must infiltrate the ravaged base, defeat the demon Gatekeeper, and seal the last Hell portal before the undead take over the world. <br />
<br />

As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.
<br>
<br>Aspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or ""Ratio"") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter.
<br>
<br>The game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the ""EO"" referring to ""Easy Operation"", a game option intended for novices to the game. The PS2 version was later released on PlayStation Network in July 2013.[2]",,,False,False,Capcom vs. SNK 2 - Millionaire Fighting 2001 (Japan):{InstallDir}\Capcom vs. SNK 2 - Millionaire Fighting 2001 (Japan).gdi,,Sega Dreamcast,

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.</p>
<p>The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.</p>
<p>Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.</p>

<br>""In “Hollow,” you are one of the pilots that transports precious resource cargo from the mining ship Shakhter-One down to Earth. One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don’t remember who you are, or how you got out there… All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.

<br>When you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship’s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and – ultimately – your life.

Magical Drop II,,"Magical Drop is played in a style and gameplay similar to Compile's (now Sega's) Puyo Puyo and Taito's Puzzle Bobble franchises; a ""stack"" of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's ""clown"" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. ""Chains"" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.
<br>
<br>There are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.",Data East,"D4 Enterprise, Data East, Sega",False,True,Magical Drop 2 (Japan):{InstallDir}\Magical Drop 2 (Japan).sfc,"Wikia:https://mdcd.fandom.com/wiki/Magical_Drop_II, Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Drop",Nintendo SNES,

Bound High!,,"Originally developed by Japan System Supply, Nintendo liked the game idea of Bound High! and took over the project later. The game was, besides Dragon Hopper, going to be one of the games, which should have saved the system with a relaunch, but it was delayed again and again until it was cancelled because of the lack of success of the Virtual Boy. At this time, the game already was completely finished.

Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.
<br>The playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric ""shockers"" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly.

Half-Life 2,,"1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br><br>
		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br><br>
		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br><br>
		The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:<br><br>
		<ul>
		<li><span class=""copyHead"">Characters:</span> Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li>
		<li><span class=""copyHead"">Physics:</span> From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.</li>
		<li><span class=""copyHead"">Graphics:</span> Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.</li>
		<li><span class=""copyHead"">AI:</span> Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.</li>

Danganronpa V3 - Killing Harmony,,"The third Dangan Ronpa game which has been confirmed at the TGS 2015 to be released on both the PS Vita and PS4.<br>
<br>
Like the title ""New"" implies, the game has a completely different storyline, characters and environment than the first three games (the ""Hope's Peak Academy"" storyline ends with an anime series), with only the series' mascot Monokuma returning. The game features a new killing game called the New Killing School Life. The new setting is called Gifted Inmates Academy or the Prison School for the Gifted. The Academy (and hotel) is in a garden surrounded by a cage. It's implied that the story is set in the future.<br>
<br>
The overall theme is mentioned to be ""psycho cool"", unlike the ""psycho pop"" and ""psycho tropical"" themes of the first two games. The visual style will have a ""cool adult-like image"" and the Class Trials will have ""high-speed reasoning action"". While the storyline and the sixteen new characters are different, the gameplay is similar to the earlier games, including exploration, talking with other characters and the Class Trials. It will have notable additions and improvements, though, like the possibility to use your own lies to defeat opponents during the trials.<br>

Comix Zone,,"Sketch Turner, a ""starving artist"" and freelance rock musician, is working on his newest comic book, named the ""Comix Zone."" Comix Zone is the story of the New World Empire's attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch's (oddly vivid) dreams and nightmares. One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, the main villain of Comix Zone - a powerful mutant named Mortus - manages to escape the comic book's pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies to try and kill him.
<br>
<br>Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero (""the chosen one"") who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus' evil plans and find a way out of this comic world before his own creations erase him for good.
<br>
<br>The game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a Nuke, when Mortus comes into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch. Comix Zone is a huge success, being sold out on its first day, and Alissa joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city's new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch's dirty socks.

Pac-Land,,"Pac-Land itself is split into trips. In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.
<br>
<br>The penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.
<br>
<br>As in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.",Namco,"Enix Corporation, Grandslam Entertainments, Namco, Quicksilva Ltd.",False,True,Pac-Land (Japan):{InstallDir}\Pac-Land (Japan).nes,Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Land,Nintendo Entertainment System,

Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness,,"Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed. 
<br>Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.","Nippon Ichi Software, Inc.","Nippon Ichi Software, Inc., NIS America",False,False,Disgaea - Afternoon of Darkness (USA):{InstallDir}\Disgaea - Afternoon of Darkness (USA).iso,"Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgaea:_Hour_of_Darkness#Disgaea:_Afternoon_of_Darkness, Official Website:http://disgaea.us/, Wikia:https://disgaea.fandom.com/wiki/Disgaea:_Afternoon_of_Darkness, Twitter:https://twitter.com/NISAmerica",Sony PlayStation Portable,

Space Pinball,,"Normally you would think that prototypes of released games are not even half as interesting as any unreleased stuff, and I'd say you're right, but in some cases those hardly resemble the final product.

What people got to play at Shoshinkai 1994 and CES 1995, where the Virtual Boy was first unveiled to the japanese and later the american people, looks (and feels) very different than the final released product, although, as you might think, many things were changed for good. 
<br> 
<br>When you start up the game, you see an early version of the adjustment screen, after which the game jumps directly to the title. No Precaution or Automatic Pause yet, but that wouldn't have made much sense anyway in an early exhibition software, would it? While the title screen looks a bit different with the different game logo, the following stage select screen has barely been changed for ""Galactic Pinball"", there are also five options which can be selected by rotating them. Instead of 4 tables and the highscores there are 5 tables in this prototype, though, and here at latest, it is becoming very interesting.

There are 30 machines on the circuit for each race in Aero GPX; and the race ends with significantly less than that. Pilots fight for the best position possible with high speeds, risky maneuvers, and visceral attacks. While Aero GPX is inspired by classics in the genre, it also has a few twists of its own to feel like a new experience with hints of nostalgia.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2161320/extras/CrimsonDrillAttackSteam.gif?t=1666097981"" /><br><br><strong><u>Core Gameplay</u></strong><br><br>The Core Gameplay of Aero GPX is best described by touching upon a few of its most important aspects:<br><br><strong>Responsive Handling and Controls</strong><br>Aero GPX aims to be one of the most responsive racing experiences you've ever played; responding instantly to your input and reacting accordingly.

Rhythm Tengoku,,"A rhythm-action game like no other from the same team that created WarioWare. Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.
<br>
<br>Rhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)
<br>
<br>The game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.
<br>
<br>Much like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).
<br>
<br>For example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.
<br>
<br>Occasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description.",Nintendo SPD Group No. 1,Nintendo,False,True,Rhythm Tengoku (Japan) (Rev 1) - Japan - Rev 1:{InstallDir}\Rhythm Tengoku (Japan) (Rev 1).gba,"Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Tengoku, Official Website:https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/brij/index.html, Wikia:https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Tengoku",Nintendo Game Boy Advance,

Surviving Mars,,"<h2>Colonize Mars and discover her secrets, with minimal casualties.</h2>
<p>Welcome Home! The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars! All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!</p>
<p>Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.</p>
<p>There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you.</p>
<h2>Main Features:</h2>
<p>Building a sustainable colony in space
Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen.</p>
<p>Individually simulated colonists
Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.</p>
<p>Futuristic Space Dome construction
Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars.</p>
<p>Exploration of Mars’ secrets
Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly?</p>
